# Agi
taking a stab at making a generative artificial generalized intelligence with the help of chat gpt

plan of action:

DataInputNet:
- Acquires data from multiple sources like sensors or files.
- Pre-processes raw data and standardizes it for further processing by LowLevelDataProcessingNet.

InputHashNet:
- Accepts preprocessed data from DataInputNet and generates a unique, efficient representation using hashing techniques like locality-sensitive hashing (LSH) or minhashing.
- Maintains a hash table for storing and referencing raw input data.

LowLevelDataProcessingNet:
- Processes preprocessed data from InputHashNet for feature extraction, signal processing, and statistical analysis.
- Outputs refined data for the IntermediateDataNet.

IntermediateDataNet:
- Serves as an intermediary between LowLevelDataProcessingNet and HighLevelDecisionMakingNet.
- Transmits refined data from LowLevelDataProcessingNet to HighLevelDecisionMakingNet.
- Incorporates memory and time components to store and track past experiences.

AttentionNet:
- Manages attention and salience within the AGI.
- Focuses on pertinent stimuli and disregards irrelevant distractions.

MotorControlNet:
- Handles motor functions based on HighLevelDecisionMakingNet's decisions.
- Coordinates planning and execution of movements.

EmotionNet:
- Generates and regulates emotional responses and motivation in the AGI.
- Influences reward processing and motivation.

SensoryProcessingNet:
- Manages sensory input processing, including vision, hearing, touch, and smell.
- Processes and integrates sensory information.

LanguageNet:
- Enables language processing and communication within the AGI.
- Facilitates interaction with others using language.

HighLevelDecisionMakingNet:
- Makes informed decisions based on input from IntermediateDataNet.
- Employs machine learning techniques to train decision-making models.
- Outputs decisions to the IntermediateOutputNet, influenced by inputs from other neural networks.

IntermediateOutputNet:
- Transmits decisions made by HighLevelDecisionMakingNet to DataOutputNet in an abstracted format.

DataOutputNet:
- Translates abstracted output from IntermediateOutputNet into a suitable format for output devices.
- Delivers output, such as motor commands or textual responses.

MemoryNet:
- Stores and manages past experiences and decisions to influence future decision-making.
- Utilizes deep learning or reinforcement learning to optimize memory storage.

TimeNet:
- Tracks the timing of experiences and decisions.
- Retrieves relevant memories or decisions based on their timing.

AGINet:
- Unifies various neural networks and provides methods for system operation and output generation.
- Facilitates data transfer between neural networks using a data bus or similar interface.
- Ensures seamless integration, learning and adaptation, scalability, generalization, robustness, and ethical and safety considerations.
- Continuously improves system performance based on input-output feedback loops.
